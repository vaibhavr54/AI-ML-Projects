# AI/ML Projects Repository

**Description**:  
This repository contains a collection of AI and machine learning projects, ranging from data analysis to advanced predictive models. Each project in this repository focuses on solving real-world problems using machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques. The repository is designed for educational purposes and showcases the use of various AI/ML algorithms, libraries, and frameworks.

## Projects Included
1. **MongoDB Query Optimization System with Machine Learning**  
   - **Description**: Predicts MongoDB query execution times and provides suggestions to optimize query performance based on metrics like index usage and query length.  
   - **Technologies**: Python, MongoDB, PyMongo, Scikit-learn  
   - **Key Features**: Predictive model for query performance, actionable performance suggestions, and analysis of query metrics.  

## Technologies Used Across Projects
- **Python**: Core programming language used for developing machine learning models and data processing.
- **Scikit-learn**: Used for implementing machine learning algorithms.
- **MongoDB/PyMongo**: For NoSQL database management and query handling in some projects.
- **NumPy and Pandas**: Libraries for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: For data visualization in some projects.
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch** (future projects): For deep learning models and AI applications.

## How to Use
1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI-ML Projects.git
   cd AI-ML Projects
   ```

2. **Explore Individual Projects**  
   Each project is organized into its own folder. Navigate into a project folder and follow its individual README file for instructions on how to run the code.

   Example:
   ```
   cd mongodb-query-optimization
   python your_script.py
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**  
   Install the required Python packages using the `requirements.txt` file (if available in a project folder):
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Projects**  
   Each project includes instructions for running the scripts and models, along with sample input data.
