# Food Delivery Time Prediction Using Python

## ðŸ“œ Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the delivery time for food orders using **Machine Learning** algorithms. Accurate delivery time predictions are essential for maintaining transparency and customer satisfaction in food delivery services like **Zomato** and **Swiggy**. By leveraging past delivery data, this system predicts real-time delivery times based on the distance between restaurants and customer locations.

## âœ¨ Objective
The goal is to develop a Machine Learning model that predicts food delivery time by:
- Calculating the distance between the food preparation point and the delivery location.
- Analyzing historical delivery data to identify patterns and relationships between distance and time.

## ðŸ”§ Tools and Libraries
This project utilizes the following Python libraries:
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating Machine Learning models.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains historical data of food delivery times, distances, and other relevant features.  
You can download the dataset from (https://github.com/vvaibhavr54/Notebooks/Food-Delivery-Time-Prediction)

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/vvaibhavr54/Notebooks/Food-Delivery-Time-Prediction.git
   cd Food-Delivery-Time-Prediction
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook Food_Delivery_Time_Prediction.ipynb
   ```

## ðŸ“ˆ Outputs
- Predicted delivery time for new food orders based on input distance and other features.
- Visualizations highlighting the relationship between distance and delivery time.

## ðŸŒŸ Applications
This project demonstrates how Machine Learning can be used to:
- Enhance customer satisfaction by providing accurate delivery time estimates.
- Improve delivery logistics for food delivery services.
