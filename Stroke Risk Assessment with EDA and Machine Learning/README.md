# Stroke Prediction with Data Insights and Machine Learning  
---
## Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing stroke-related data and building predictive models using Machine Learning to assess stroke risk. By leveraging Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and advanced ML techniques, the notebook uncovers key insights and demonstrates the power of predictive analytics in healthcare.  

## Key Features  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** In-depth analysis of the dataset to identify trends, correlations, and key risk factors.  
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.  
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implementation of classification models to predict stroke risk.  
- **Performance Metrics:** Evaluation of models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  

## Dataset  
The project uses a publicly available stroke dataset (mention the source if applicable). The dataset includes features like:  
- Age  
- Gender  
- Hypertension  
- Heart Disease  
- Average Glucose Level  
- Body Mass Index (BMI)  

## Tools and Technologies  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
- **Development Environment:** Jupyter Notebook  

## How to Run the Project  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/vaibhavr54/Stroke-EDA-and-ML.git
   cd Stroke-EDA-and-ML
   ```  
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:  
   ```
   jupyter notebook Stroke\ EDA\ and\ ML.ipynb
   ```  
3. Execute the cells in the notebook to analyze the data and build the models.  

## Results  
- Key insights into stroke risk factors from EDA.  
- Predictive models with performance metrics for stroke risk classification.
